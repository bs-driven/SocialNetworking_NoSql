### READ ME

## Motivation
The goal of this project was to demonstrate the use of NOSQL. Creating a social networking site well more so the backend for a social site.
This is to diplay the use of Mongoose DB. Using crontrollers, models, and routes.

### Problems
My problem with this project had more to do with test the routes i created and understanding excatly how to use the routes in Insomina.
I kept putting things in worng when trying to test it even once I finished I had issues trying to make a video displaying how to go about using the api routes. 

### What I Learned
What I learned from this project is how to read routes properly and to create routes in mongoose. The use of findOneandUpdate and simular routes attached to mongoose. To clarify about routes that I just mention I mean being able to read routes in order to get the information I seek in mongoose. As I mentioned earlier I was having a problem.
